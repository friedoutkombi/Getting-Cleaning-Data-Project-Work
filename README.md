###Overview.

The project is the capstone piece of work for the Getting & CLeaning Data project.
It consists of downloading a dataset and tidying it up in various ways.
The original dataset can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

###Ready To Go.

Please be aware the R script requires the changing of the source file prior to completing the rest of the script.
You can bypass the first stages of setting the directory and loading in the data if you are comfortable with another method.

###Overrall
  
This script consists of:
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
-Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
